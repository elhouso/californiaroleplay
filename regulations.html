        <h1>Regulations</h1>
        
        <h2>Discord Rules</h2>
        <p>(1.0) Treat all community members with the utmost respect and refrain from any form of bullying, harassment, or threats at all times.</p>
        <p>(1.2) Your Discord nickname should match your ROBLOX username, with the exception of using callsigns, which should be separated by a pipe symbol.</p>
        <p>(1.3) We have a strict zero-tolerance policy for posting or sharing any NSFW or hateful content, including text, images, voice chats, or links.</p>
        <p>(1.4) Please respect the content filter and avoid attempting to bypass it. Additionally, use profanity sparingly, and note that racial slurs are strictly prohibited.</p>
        <p>(1.5) Make sure to use channels for their intended purposes and engage appropriately.</p>
        <p>(1.6) Drama or disrespect toward other servers is not allowed. Any related discussions should be taken to direct messages.</p>
        <p>(1.7) For clarity and consistency, English is the only language permitted within the community.</p>
        <p>(1.8) For assistance, please avoid pinging supervisors or higher staff directly. Instead, create a support ticket. Please also refrain from pinging HR members.</p>
        
        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>(1.0) Everything you do in our server should be realistic. Please avoid using unrealistic avatars or driving in an unrealistic manner. Always roleplay your crashes.</p>
        <p>(1.2) Random deathmatching is strictly prohibited. Only engage in combat if you have a valid reason.</p>
        <p>(1.3) Vehicle deathmatching is not allowed. Always ensure you have a legitimate reason before crashing into another player's vehicle.</p>
        <p>(1.4) Upon dying, you must roleplay as a completely new character. You cannot retain knowledge or behaviors from your previous life(s).</p>
        <p>(1.5) You must act as if you're genuinely fearing for your life when threatened, such as when a weapon is aimed at you. You cannot draw a weapon if one is already pointed at you.</p>
        <p>(1.6) When arresting another player, you must clearly announce that you're drawing your cuffs (e.g., "cuffs"). Do not run up to a player and cuff them without proper roleplay to detain them.</p>
        <p>(1.7) A minimum of two players is required to rob either the jewelry store or Liberty County Bank.</p>
